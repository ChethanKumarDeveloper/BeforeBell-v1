    <h3>1. About BeforeBell</h3>
    <p>
      BeforeBell is a student academic support platform that provides assistance with reports,
      assignments, PPTs, seminar presentations, software projects, and custom academic help.
      We do not represent any college or university.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Nature of Service</h3>
    <p>
      All services provided by BeforeBell are intended for academic assistance and reference purposes only.
      Final submission, usage, and responsibility lie entirely with the student.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Booking & Communication</h3>
    <p>
      Services can be booked through our website form or live chat. Scope of work, pricing,
      and delivery timelines will be confirmed before work begins.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Pricing</h3>
    <p>
      Prices start from ₹499/-. Final pricing depends on complexity, scope, and deadline.
      Once confirmed, pricing will not change unless requirements are modified.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Preview & Payment Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Completed work is initially shared in a password-protected format. Payment is required
      to receive the password and final editable files.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Corrections Policy</h3>
    <p>
      One free correction is provided within the original scope of work. Additional changes
      or new requirements may incur extra charges.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Delivery Timeline</h3>
    <p>
      Delivery timelines are shared during confirmation. Delays caused due to late requirement
      changes or incomplete information from the student are not the responsibility of BeforeBell.
    </p>

    <h3>8. No Grade Guarantee</h3>
    <p>
      BeforeBell does not guarantee grades, marks, or academic results. Outcomes depend on
      student usage and institutional evaluation standards.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Plagiarism & Originality</h3>
    <p>
      Work is created with original effort. Students are responsible for reviewing content
      and making final modifications if required. BeforeBell is not liable for institutional
      plagiarism checks.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Once work is delivered in preview form, no refunds will be issued. If BeforeBell is unable
      to deliver the agreed work, a full refund will be provided.
    </p>

    <h3>11. Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      All student data and files are kept confidential and are not shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h3>12. Right to Refuse Service</h3>

      are unethical, illegal, or involve abusive behavior.
    </p>

      These Terms & Conditions may be updated at any time. Updated versions will be available
      on the website.
